## SDL Samples

Follow up on the SDL samples from the SDL roadmap.

TO-DO

Verify sdl_image is properly intalled and where it is, I installed with brew btw
[RETRO]
Seems homebrew install packages sdl_image in /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.6.3_1 so I had to create a system link pointing to /usr/local/include/sdl so that the compiler can find it

Somehow exercise is not working yet, I thought it was a setup issue, but I found an online exercise which I run and it's working so I don't know what is wrong with the exercise.

Glosary
