# C workspace

## Project list

### 1. SDL Samples

Here first steps in sdl work, 
mostly following this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFLa3ln16w0
Most of the documentation out there is SDL with C++, so this is the best introduction I found, once I can follow how to use the basic, perhaps I can try to port C++ samples to C.

### 2. SDL

SDL cloned repository it was installed manually.

Note: I had to install sdl_image too, installed through homebrew
homebrew tools are installed in `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/` and C dependencies should be `/usr/local/include/` then I created a system link `sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.8.8/include/SDL2/SDL_image.h /usr/local/include/SDL2/`

### FFMPEG tutorial

This is based on https://github.com/leandromoreira/ffmpeg-libav-tutorial?tab=readme-ov-file#chapter-0---the-infamous-hello-world

I don't even remember what is the status of this.
