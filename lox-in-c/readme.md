# C caveats found out up to know

- No array lists
seems there's no a data structure like js and other dynamic languages, I try to create and array list but seems in not possble option
- No string length, which could be good though, why could be good?


# Notes

Even though I consider I have enough knowledge with C I need to lear design system for C, right now my mindset is focused to TS, javascript even a little to golang but everything to higher level. Then I'm going to check how this works

Because I don't know how to do the substring behavior myself, likely I'm going to need to address it differently. That's why I need to do this tutorial first. Which is still a good thing.
I can ask to AI how to do it but not always the short road is the best. I need to learn how to get answers by myself.
